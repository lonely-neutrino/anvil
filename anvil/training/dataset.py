"""Decision-window dataset over a TrajectoryStore (M1 D4/D5).

Streams games (IterableDataset — random access would decode a whole zstd
frame per sample), yields one task-tagged example per rung-1 decision:
priority windows (the bulk) plus the one-field family (mull_keep/mull_tuck/
trigger/binary/number — see TASKS). Every example carries the same state
tensors; task-specific label fields are pad values (-1) elsewhere. Priority
examples:

  entities   (N, F) float32   dedup-group rows from the transform
  ent_emb    (N,)   int64     row into the embedding cache (-1 = hidden/token)
  globals    (G,)   float32
  players    (P, Q) float32
  history    (K, 3) int64     (method-id, actor-is-self, host-row or -1)
  cand_rows  (C,)   int64     candidate source rows; index 0 is always PASS (-1)
  cand_sa    (C,)   int64     SA-string vocab id per candidate (-1 = PASS/pad)
  cand_kind  (C,)   int64     KINDS id per candidate (-1 = PASS/pad)
  label      ()     int64     index into cand_rows the expert chose; -1 = the
                              SA-level label is ambiguous (masked from policy
                              loss; measured ~0.003% of casts, D2 sweep)
  label_row  ()     int64     expert's chosen HOST row (-1 = pass) — the
                              host-level agreement basis (continuity with M1),
                              known even when the SA-level label is masked
  has_outcome / won ()        value-head target (games without outcomes carry
                              has_outcome=0 and are excluded from value loss)

Design notes:
- All windows kept, pass included as candidate 0 (m1-bc-plan: imbalance is a
  training-time knob — weighting/downsampling lives in the sampler, not here).
- Candidates are (host dedup-group row, normalized SA string) pairs from the
  logged timing-legal options (ADR-0005 basis; M2 D2 moves the interface from
  host rows to SAs). Identical (row, sa) options collapse into ONE candidate:
  entity-level duplicates are §2 multiset semantics ("a Rat Colony"), and
  SA-level duplicates (commander permission routes, same-rendering cost
  variants) are indistinguishable to the model anyway — collapsing them makes
  the expert label exact at candidate level; the executor keeps first-fit for
  the residual engine-side tie.
- Labels resolve in order: exact logged option index ("oi", rets since
  2026-07-10) -> exact normalized-string match at the chosen host -> prefix-min
  match (the option/plan serializations truncate at different lengths) ->
  masked (-1). Masked windows keep their state, host-level label, and value
  target; the target/X heads are padded out (their conditioning is the chosen
  candidate, which is exactly what is unknown).
- entity_row_of is loader plumbing (label/candidate resolution); it is never
  a model input, so entity ids stay out of the information set.
- Windows whose chosen host resolves to no candidate row are IMPOSSIBLE by
  ADR-0005 construction; the loader raises rather than skipping (a silent
  skip here would hide exactly the corpus-poisoning class the validator
  exists to catch).

Combat examples (M2 D5, tasks attack/block) add per-candidate-row fields
(pad -1 / empty on other tasks; batch-padded in collate):

  cmb_rows        (A,) int64  candidate creature dedup rows (derived basis:
                              decider's battlefield creatures, untapped
                              [+unsick for attacks] — certified label superset)
  cmb_count       (A,) int64  dedup-group size (clamped COMBAT_COUNT_MAX)
  atk_label       (A,) int64  attack task: 1/0 per row
  cmb_count_label (A,) int64  k-1 class for multi-groups that acted (both tasks)
  atk_tgt_kind/idx(A,) int64  attack target per attacking row (0=entity row,
                              1=player position; -1 = none or mixed-in-group,
                              masked) -> collate builds atk_tgt_labels class ids
  blk_label       (A,) int64  block task: index into blk_atk_rows, or the none
                              class (per-example len(blk_atk_rows), remapped to
                              the batch none slot M in collate); -1 = masked
                              (multi-block or group split across attackers)
  blk_atk_rows    (M,) int64  attacker rows in the dec obs (pointer key set)

Labels come from the obs-side join (_combat_label_window): the declare
callbacks never serialized rets, but post-declaration windows carry atk/blk
flags. The join is bounded at the next declareAttackers dec — turn-only
bounding poisoned 145 corpus block labels via extra-combat overshoot
(classified 2026-07-13). Forced-empty windows (no candidates / no attackers)
are skipped: nothing to learn, and serve answers them without the model.
