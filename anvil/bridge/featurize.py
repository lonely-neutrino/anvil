"""Wire observation -> model batch, and model output -> wire answer (M1 D8).

The featurization half MIRRORS anvil.training.dataset.PriorityWindows._examples
FIELD FOR FIELD — this is the train/serve skew boundary: any change to the
loader's featurization must land here (and vice versa). Labels are pads at
serve time; the shared pieces (assemble, EmbeddingCache, MethodVocab, SaVocab,
norm_sa, collate) are imported, not copied. Since M2 D2 priority candidates
are (host row, normalized SA) pairs with identical keys collapsed; aux's
cand_first_opt maps the model's candidate choice back to the first matching
wire-option index (first-fit among collapsed duplicates, matching the
training label semantics).

History arrives pre-extracted from the worker ("hist": last-K prior decisions
as {"m","p","e"}, hosts back-filled at ret time to match the training loader's
joined view); the information-set rule is applied here, mirroring
transform.history_tokens.
