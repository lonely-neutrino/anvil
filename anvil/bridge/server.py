"""Anvil decision server (M0 echo/random + M1 model): answers DecisionBridge sessions.

Modes:
- echo   -- echo the worker's pre-drawn answer back (bridge-tax instrument:
            gRPC-arm games are bit-identical to local-arm games, so the
            throughput delta isolates serialization + transport).
- random -- answer uniformly at random server-side, seeded per game from
            GameStart.seed (deterministic per seed; the M1-shaped mode).
- model  -- M1 D8: featurize the wire observation (same code path as the
            training loader), run AnvilNet.act, answer CastPlans + one-field
            tags. --ckpt required; --pass-delta is the calibration arm knob
            (pass_calibration.json "delta"). mtg.mulligan_tuck stays
            heuristic-fallback at D8 (SELECT_K answer mapping deferred).

Run: uv run python -m anvil.bridge.server [--port 50051] [--mode echo]
     [--tags mtg.priority,mtg.mulligan_keep,...]
     [--ckpt data/training/d7-ep3/last.pt --pass-delta 0.0]

One bidirectional stream per worker; one outstanding request per stream by
construction (the worker's game thread blocks), so the servicer is a plain
loop. Model inference is batch-1 behind a lock at first light — micro-batching
across streams is the known lever if the w=16 arms want it. Stats print on
Ctrl-C.
